## Overview

FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) is an open standard for online authentication, aiming to eliminate the vulnerabilities of
passwords. FIDO uses public-key cryptography instead of symmetric credentials like passwords or PINs.

In essence, the user's device generates a key pair, storing the private key securely and sharing the public key with the
server. During both registration and authentication, the server challenges the device, and the device responds with a
digital signature using the private key. The server then verifies this signature with the stored public key. This
challenge-response protocol helps prevent replay attacks.

### What is FIDO2?

FIDO2 is an enhancement of the FIDO standard for web and other platforms, supported by major web browsers and operating
systems. It encompasses two primary operations: Registration and Authentication.

#### Registration

- The user selects a FIDO authenticator that meets the service’s acceptance policy.
- The user unlocks the authenticator via fingerprint, PIN, or another method.
- A public/private key pair is generated; the public key is sent to the service and associated with the user’s account,
  while the private key remains on the device.
- The service challenges the device, which then creates a response using the private key to finish the registration
  process.

#### Authentication

- The service challenges the user to log in with a previously registered device.
- The user unlocks the authenticator using the same method as during registration.
- The device signs the service’s challenge and sends it back to the service.
- The service verifies the signature with the stored public key and grants access.

### Challenge-Response Protocol

Both the registration and authentication processes utilize a challenge-response protocol to prevent replay attacks.
During registration, a challenge is sent from the server to the device and the device responds using its private key.
Similarly, during authentication, another challenge is sent to verify the user's identity. This ensures that each
attempt is unique and secure.

## Modules

- **rp-server**:
    - RP Server Demo
    - Depends on **common**
- **common**:
    - Message classes that are commonly referenced by both the FIDO2 Server and the RP Server
- **core**:
    - Contains the core domain logic of FIDO
    - If the FIDO2 server being implemented does not interact with an RDB, this module alone should be used
    - Depends on **common**
- **base**:
    - Contains classes that depend on Spring JPA
        - Service Implement classes, Repository interfaces, Entity classes
    - Depends on **core**
- **demo**:
    - FIDO2 server demo application
    - Depends on **base**

## How to Run

### Manual Run

Start the RP Server and FIDO2 Server:

```bash
# Start RP Server
cd rpserver
./gradlew bootRun

# Start FIDO2 Server
cd fido2-demo/demo
./gradlew bootRun
```

### Docker for demo

If you have Docker configured, you can use docker-compose.

```bash
# Start both RP Server and FIDO2 Server
docker-compose up
```

Once the applications are running, access the test page at:

- http://localhost:8080/

### Local DB

The FIDO2 Server uses H2 as an embedded DB in a local environment, which should be replaced with a standalone DB (like
MySQL) for staging, beta, or production environments. Access the H2 web console at:

- http://localhost:8081/h2-console

### Issues

- If data.sql doesn't work well in an IntelliJ environment,
  try commenting on this part in build.gradle.

```groovy
jar {
    processResources {
        exclude("**/*.sql")
    }
}
```

## API Guides

### Spring REST Docs

To view the API documentation, follow these steps:

1. Execute the following commands:
   ```bash

## LINE WebAuthn Android and iOS

We are also providing Client SDK for Android/iOS applications. Please see below.

### checkOrigin Configuration

The `checkOrigin` method validates the origin of requests from LINE's Android and iOS applications. It ensures security
by checking that the request's origin matches a pre-configured list of allowed origins.

How to Configure
To use the `checkOrigin` method, set up the allowed origins in the `application.yml` file. Here is an example
configuration:

```yaml
app:
  origins:
    - android:aaa-bbb
    - ios:aaa-bbb
```

**Note:** Replace `aaa-bbb` with the appropriate values for your application.

**Important:** This configuration is optional and only necessary when integrating with LINE WebAuthn for Android and iOS
applications.
